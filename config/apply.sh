#!/bin/bash
# Configures the BusyBox submodule for NeoOS.
#
# Mirrors neoos-kernel's third_party/shim/apply.sh: the submodule stays
# a pristine upstream checkout, and everything NeoOS-specific lives
# here. Adapted from the monorepo's third_party/busybox-config/apply.sh
# for the standalone port-repo build contract (MUSL_DIR points at an
# INSTALLED musl layout -- include/, lib/libc.a, lib/crt1.o -- not the
# monorepo's in-tree uninstalled musl source tree).
#
# allnoconfig, then the fragment over the top, then `oldconfig` to
# resolve whatever the fragment made newly reachable.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this script is defensive, in three parts, each a real failure:
#
# 1. The resolve step used to be `silentoldconfig`, which REFUSES to
#    choose when input is redirected rather than taking the default:
#
#        Maximum screen width (FEATURE_VI_MAX_LEN) [4096] (NEW) aborted!
#        Console input/output is redirected. Run 'make oldconfig'
#
#    It worked until the fragment grew enough to make a numeric symbol
#    newly reachable -- adding CONFIG_VI did it. `oldconfig` is the
#    command that message names, and it answers blank input with each
#    symbol's default.
#
# 2. When that aborted, `set -e` left a HALF-WRITTEN .config behind, and
#    busybox's own make then completed it by taking defaults for
#    everything unresolved -- pulling in udhcpc, which needs
#    <linux/filter.h> and cannot build here. That is why `make shell`
#    failed intermittently and with an error nowhere near the cause. The
#    config is built on a copy now and installed only on success; any
#    failure removes it entirely, so the next run starts clean rather
#    than inheriting a broken one.
#
# 3. A fragment key that is not an upstream symbol is IGNORED by kconfig
#    with a warning lost in the build output. Renames had silently
#    stopped taking effect that way. They now fail the build.
#
# Two alternatives were tried and rejected, both worth recording:
#
#   - `yes n | make oldconfig` HANGS. `n` is not a valid answer for a
#     numeric symbol, so kconfig asks the same question forever.
#   - `make allnoconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=<file>` is exactly the right
#     mechanism on newer kconfigs, but not on this one:
#     scripts/kconfig/conf.c reads the file and then runs its
#     set-everything-to-no pass TWICE, deliberately, to defeat `select`
#     -- so the file's values are wiped and CONFIG_ASH comes out unset.
